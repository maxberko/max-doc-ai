# New: Workflow Builder

Hello,

We're excited to announce the Workflow Builder, a visual, no-code interface for creating automated workflows that connect your tools and eliminate repetitive tasks.

## What is Workflow Builder?

Workflow Builder gives you a drag-and-drop canvas for building powerful automations without writing code. Whether you're automating employee onboarding, bug triage, sales lead enrichment, or DevOps deployments, you can now build complex multi-step workflows that previously required developer resources.

## Key Capabilities

**Visual Drag-and-Drop Interface**
Build workflows on an intuitive canvas by dragging triggers, actions, and conditions into place. No coding required—just point, click, and configure. The visual interface makes it easy to understand your automation at a glance.

**100+ Integrations**
Connect your existing tools including Slack, GitHub, Jira, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Asana, and dozens more. Each integration provides triggers (what starts the workflow) and actions (what the workflow does).

**Smart Triggers**
Start workflows automatically based on app events (new issue created, message posted), schedules (daily, weekly, custom cron), or webhooks (HTTP requests from external systems). Workflows run automatically—no manual intervention needed.

**Conditional Logic**
Add if/then rules to control when actions execute. For example: "If bug severity is High, create PagerDuty incident and notify on-call engineer. If Medium, assign to team and add to sprint." Build intelligent workflows that make decisions based on your data.

**Real-Time Testing**
Test workflows with sample data before activating them. See exactly what will happen, review detailed execution logs, and make adjustments—all without affecting your live systems or execution limits.

**Error Handling**
Configure retry logic, error notifications, and fallback workflows. If something fails, your workflow can automatically retry with exponential backoff, alert you via Slack or email, or trigger an alternative workflow.

**Template Library**
Start from 50+ pre-built templates for common use cases like employee onboarding, bug triage, sales lead routing, social media monitoring, and more. Customize any template for your specific needs.

## Who Should Use This?

Workflow Builder is perfect for anyone who needs to automate repetitive, multi-step processes:

- **Operations teams** automating employee onboarding, IT provisioning, and access management
- **Engineering teams** automating bug triage, deployment workflows, and incident response
- **Sales teams** automating lead enrichment, assignment, and follow-up
- **Support teams** automating ticket routing, escalation, and customer communication
- **Marketing teams** automating campaign workflows, lead nurturing, and reporting

If you find yourself doing the same series of steps repeatedly, Workflow Builder can automate it.

## Real Results

Early users are seeing significant time savings:

- HR team reduced onboarding time from 2 hours to 5 minutes per employee
- Engineering team improved critical bug response time by 75%
- Sales team increased lead conversion rate by 40% with faster, smarter routing

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first automation? Click "Workflows" in the main menu, then "Create Workflow". You'll see our visual canvas where you can start building immediately.

We recommend starting with a simple workflow (one trigger, one action) to get familiar with the interface, then gradually adding more complexity.
