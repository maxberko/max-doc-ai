# 🚀 Introducing max-doc-ai: Automate Your Documentation Workflow

Stop spending hours on documentation. max-doc-ai uses Claude Code to analyze your codebase, capture screenshots, generate docs, and create announcements—all automatically.

**What it does:**
- 🔍 **Codebase Analysis** - Claude explores your code to understand features and write accurate documentation
- 📸 **Automated Screenshots** - Playwright captures consistent product screenshots with saved auth sessions
- 📝 **Documentation Generation** - Creates comprehensive, user-focused docs based on actual implementation
- 🔄 **Knowledge Base Sync** - Publishes directly to Pylon KB with CDN-hosted images
- 📢 **Multi-Channel Announcements** - Generates tailored Slack and email announcements automatically

Perfect for product teams, developer relations, and technical writers who need to ship documentation as fast as they ship features.
