# New: Dashboards

Hello,

We're excited to announce Dashboards, a powerful new way to visualize and track your team's workflow performance in real-time.

## What are Dashboards?

Dashboards give you instant visibility into the metrics that matter most to your team. Instead of digging through logs or running manual reports, you can now see key performance indicators at a glance and spot trends before they become issues.

## Key Capabilities

**Real-Time Metrics**
Track your workflow performance as it happens. Dashboards update automatically, so you always have the latest information without refreshing or waiting for scheduled reports.

**Drag-and-Drop Customization**
Build the perfect dashboard for your needs in seconds. Add, remove, and rearrange widgets to focus on what matters most to you and your team. No technical skills required.

**Smart Insights**
Get actionable recommendations based on your workflow data. Our analytics engine surfaces trends, anomalies, and opportunities you might otherwise miss.

**Team Collaboration**
Share dashboards with your team or create role-specific views. Everyone sees the information they need, presented the way they need it. Perfect for daily standups, weekly reviews, or executive reporting.

**Export & Reporting**
Generate reports directly from your dashboards for stakeholder updates, retrospectives, or compliance needs. Export as PDF, CSV, or PNG image.

## Who Should Use This?

Dashboards are perfect for team leads, managers, and anyone who needs to monitor workflow performance, identify bottlenecks, or make data-driven decisions quickly. Whether you're tracking project milestones, monitoring automation efficiency, or managing team workload, Dashboards help you stay on top of what's happening.

## Getting Started

Ready to try it? Access Dashboards from your main menu under "Analytics". Your first dashboard is automatically created with recommended widgets, but you can customize it however you like.

For detailed instructions, widget explanations, and best practices, check out our [documentation](https://placeholder-docs-url.com/dashboards).

- Pre-built dashboard templates for common use cases
- Mobile dashboard view
- Advanced analytics widgets
- Integration with external BI tools
